# Hi there, I'm Ozgun Aksoy  

I’m an iOS Developer based in Canada with a background in Software Engineering (M.Sc.) and a passion for creating apps that feel simple, smooth, and enjoyable to use.  

My journey started with curiosity about how things work under the hood, which led me into software engineering and eventually into the world of iOS development. Since then, I’ve had the chance to work on large-scale applications like banking and enterprise tools, as well as smaller freelance projects where I could experiment more freely. What I love most is turning an idea into something real that people can tap, swipe, and rely on in their daily lives.  

These days I spend most of my time working with **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, but I also have experience with UIKit, different architectural patterns, and the wider iOS ecosystem. I enjoy solving tough technical problems, but I care just as much about clean design and how the final app feels in someone’s hands.  

Outside of client work, I keep learning—whether that’s digging into the latest Swift features, exploring advanced UI/UX design principles, or simply tinkering with side projects that let me test new ideas.  

If you’re working on something exciting and need someone who loves building iOS apps that are both functional and user-friendly, I’d be happy to connect.
